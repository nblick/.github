## About nBlick
nBlick is an AI-driven analytics platform that helps businesses understand what Large Language Models (LLMs) think about their brands. We analyze responses from models like **ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and more** to extract key insights such as:

- **Brand Sentiment Analysis**
- **Share of Voice Metrics**
- **Comparative Brand Perception**
- **Emerging Trends & Consumer Insights**

Our goal is to provide companies with a clear view of how AI-generated content shapes public perception and brand narratives.

## Why this matters
LLMs are becoming a major force in shaping opinions, influencing search results, and generating content at scale. nBlick enables brands to **track, measure, and optimize their AI presence**, ensuring they stay ahead in an AI-driven world.
